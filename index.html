            ArcheAge is set in a fantasy world of magic and adventure. The world is completely open with free travel
            between all zones, with a few dungeons, and openly contestable world bosses. Players are also able to own
            their own housing in designated areas of each zone and trade and sell things on a player driven auction
            system. The waters between continents are where the fun began, trade routes between factions lead to some
            really fun and unique battles on player owned and driven merchant and battleships. Alongside all these areas
            and events ArcheAge has one of the most unique class systems in the world of mmorpgâ€™s; every character can
            change to any class at any time by selecting three skill trees of the ten in game totaling over one hundred
            and twenty different classes.

            Crafting in ArcheAge created another avenue of character customization, even though it was heavily based on
            random chance, it offers different stat combinations and armor types for multiple styles of play. Later
            introduced was a crafting system that was cheaper and linear so it was more for the meta classes. Weapons
            and armor are both crafted from materials farmed on player land and with resources gained through
            international trading, the second crafting system or the obsidian system also require materials from the
            bosses and mobs that spawned in around the world.
