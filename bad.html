                Early on the game suffered from massive amounts of cheaters and exploiters using knowledge of game
                issues
                from its previous release in Korea. Speed hacking to take land and the start of servers was crippling to
                the
                player base right on launch. Exploiting ways to duplicate ingame currency was up to bat next. Several
                players only a few weeks into the game had astronomical amounts of money causing inflated markets for
                the
                players that earned gold legitimately. These players, both cheaters and exploiters went unpunished by
                Trion
                worlds for months, so for months a majority of the player base was unable to make any progress. Who
                wants to
                play when you canâ€™t move forward?
            </p>

            <p>
                As cheaters were banned and bugs were patched the game moved towards its first major update, ArcheAge
                2.0
                heroes awaken. With 2.0 came new zones, new levels, new skills, and new disasters. Some of these hit
                before
                that patch was even release, with an unexplained two month delay Trion remained silent. Over a month
                after
                the originally intended release Trion made a statement for the new launch date, December-ish. Launch day
                was
                more
                disappointment, from server crashes to mass player disconnects and still almost complete radio silence
                from
                Trion as the world of archeage was burning and taking its player base with it. Some forty eight hours
                into
                the launch Trion finally responded to the cries of its players, they would not be doing a rollback or
                any
                form of fixes to give all players a fair chance at the new content. One server in particular only had 12
                people able to connect for those forty eight hours, all of which where in the same guild and managed to
                claim all of the new zones for their guild.
