                Currently under Gamingo, many active players are saying the game is better than it’s ever been and the
                private server is very active as well. With all the ArcheAge and ArcheRage have to offer it’s sit an
                amazing
                game worth dabbling in. In the future, rather than trying to repair ArcheAge in its current state it
                might
                be wiser to move on to a second version of the game. The bad stigma and outdated technology around AA as
                it
                is now may prove to difficult to overcome. A private server is attempting to save the game but has been
                riddled with its own issues, they have released custom content and have more stable servers, however the
                idea of it still being ArcheAge has still made it unappealing to play. If any developer can learn from
                all
                of this I hope it’s that they create a game with the freedom of ArcheAge but really work on better
                customer
                service, testing, and are more reactive to problems. ArcheAge 2 could restart the world something like
                FFXIV
                Realm Reborn with a new company or even an entirely new game that has all of the combat and world
                mechanics
                that make the game so much fun.
